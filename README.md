# Snake-Project-
This repository implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent using the Policy Gradient (REINFORCE) algorithm to play the classic Snake Game. The agent is trained using PyGame Learning Environment (PLE) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that processes grayscale images of the game screen and predicts the best actions.
